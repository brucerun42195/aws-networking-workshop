**AWS Networking Workshop**
--------------------

More and more customers have been migrating their production workloads from on-premises into AWS cloud. But in the mean time, it's a huge challenge on how to connect tens or hundreds of VPC together and still have ability to control routing. Additionally, how to build a hybrid DNS architecture to allow all workloads communicating each other through DNS is a complicated question as well.

The objective of this workshop is to take you to build a hybrid architecture step by step by using three AWS networking services, AWS Transit Gateway, AWS Client VPN and Route53 Resolver. In the workshop, we will create 3 VPCs, 2 of them are application VPC and the other is shared services VPC where we will create AWS managed Microsoft Directory, AWS Client VPN endpoints and DNS service.The diagram below is the architecture we will build in this workshop.    

![Deployment Diagram](images/architecture.jpg)

**IMPORTANT** - You Must Select N.Virginia (us-east-1) Region For This Workshop.

**STEP 1 - Enviornment Set-Up**
---------------------------

For avoiding misconfiguration, we will create the workshop environment by using CloudFormation. Copy the link below and past it as the template URL. 

<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ykwang-networking-workshop/networking-workshop.yaml>

1) Choose **Creat new stack** on the CloudFormation page.
 
![Deployment Diagram](images/newstack.jpg)

2) Past the link under **Specify an Amazon S3 template URL** and click **Next**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/templateurl.jpg)

3) Specify your stack name and choose **KeyName** for accessing EC2 via SSH, then click **Next**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/stackname.jpg)

4) Click **Next** to skip **Option** page and click **Create** on **Review** page. CloudFormation will automatically create the VPCs and related resources. Wait about 25 ~ 30 minutes and make sure the status is **CREATE_COMPLETE**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/createcomplete.jpg)

5) Verify all resources CloudFormation created are identical as below.  

**VPC AND SUBNET**

* VPC4VPN - 10.1.0.0/16 (VPC4VPN-SN1 - 10.1.1.0/24, VPC4VPN-SN2 - 10.1.2.0/24)
* VPC10 - 10.10.0.0/16 (VPC10-SN1 - 10.10.1.0/24, VPC10-SN2 - 10.10.2.0/24)
* VPC20 - 10.20.0.0/16 (VPC20-SN1 - 10.20.1.0/24, VPC20-SN2 - 10.20.2.0/24)

**EC2 INSTANCE (Record your EC2 private IP)**

* ICMP Client in VPC10 - IP 10.10.1.X
* ICMP Client in VPC20 - IP 10.10.2.X

**Directory Service (Record MicrosoftAD DNS address)**

![Deployment Diagram](images/addns.jpg)

**STEP 2 - Create VPN User In Microsoft AD**
---------------------------
To create users and groups in an AWS Directory Service directory, you must be connected to a EC2 instance that has been joined to your AWS Directory Service directory, and be logged in as a user that has privileges to create users and groups. You will also need to install the Active Directory Tools on your EC2 instance so you can add your users and groups with the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.

**STEP 3 - Create AWS Client VPN**
----------------------------------------------
**What is AWS Client VPN?**

AWS Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN service that enables you to securely access your AWS resources and resources in your on-premises network. With Client VPN, you can access your resources from any location using an OpenVPN-based VPN client. 

![Deployment Diagram](images/step3.jpg)

1) Generate a Server Certificate and import into ACM

**IMPORTANT** - AWS CLI tool is essential in this step. If the laptop you use without AWS CLI tool, you can ssh to EC2 instance in VPC10 to complete it.  

Follow the instruction below to generate a server certificate and upload it into ACM.

1. Clone the OpenVPN easy-rsa repo to your local computer.

		$ git clone https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa.git
		
2. Navigate into the easy-rsa/easyrsa3 folder in your local repo. 

		$ cd easy-rsa/easyrsa3
		
3. Initialize a new PKI environment.

		$ ./easyrsa init-pki
		
4. Build a new certificate authority (CA).

		$ ./easyrsa build-ca nopass
		
5. Generate the server certificate and key.

		$ ./easyrsa build-server-full server nopass

6. Copy the server certificate and key to a custom folder and then navigate into the custom folder. 

		$ cp pki/ca.crt /custom_folder/
		$ cp pki/issued/server.crt /custom_folder/
		$ cp pki/private/server.key /custom_folder/
		$ cd /custom_folder/
		
7. Upload the server certificate and key to ACM.

		$ aws acm import-certificate --certificate file://server.crt --private-key file://server.key --certificate-chain file://ca.crt --region us-east-1

Open **Certificate Manage** console, expand the details page of certificate you just imported and record the resource ARN.

![Deployment Diagram](images/importcert.jpg)

2) Create a Client VPN Endpoint

Open the Amazon VPC console, choose **Client VPN Endpoints** and choose **Create Client VPN Endpoint**. Do the following:

* Type **Networking Workshop** for **Name Tag**
* Type **192.168.200.0/22** for **Client IPv4 CIDR**
* Select **arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:xxx:certificate:xxxx** for **Server certificate ARN**
* Choose **Use Active Directory authentication** for **Authentication Options**
* Select **d-xxxxxxxxxx** for **Directory ID**
* Select **No** for **Connection Logging**
* Leave **DNS IP address** as blank and select **UDP** for 
**Transport Protocol**

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpnendpoint.jpg)

3) Configure Client VPN Endpoint

Select the client VPN endpoint and choose **Associations**, click **Associate**. Select the vpc-id of **VPC4VPN** for **VPC** setting and select subnet-id with us-east-1a for **Choose a subnet to associate**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/targetnetwork.jpg)

The VPC's default security group is automatically applied for the subnet association. Make sure all traffic is allowed for inbound rules and outbound rules . Select the client VPN endpoint and choose **Authorization**, click **Authorize Ingress**. Type **0.0.0.0/0** for **Destination network to enable**, select **Allow access to all users** and click **Add authorization rule**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/authorizerule.jpg)

Click **Route Table** and **Create Route**. Type **0.0.0.0/0** for Route destination and select **subnet-xxxx** for **Target VPC Subnet ID**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/createroute.jpg)

Click **Summary** to review the setting and go through each tab.

![Deployment Diagram](images/settingreview.jpg)

4) Connect Your AWS Client VPN

**IMPORTANT** - Make sure you've installed OpenVPN client in your laptop or mobile device. If not, check the link below to install.

* Windows - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/windows.html>
* MacOS - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/macos.html>
* Android and iOS - <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/android.html>

Click **Download Client Configuration** and store the ovpn file in your loacl disk.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpncfg.jpg)

In this step, the illustration was captured from Tunnelblick which is a free OpenVPN client for MacOS. You can reference the steps because the working process of most OpenVPN clients is similar. 
Open your OpenVPN client and import the OpenVPN config(.ovpn file). Click **connect**, type the username and password that you created for vpn user in Active Directory. The OpenVPN client will automatically establish VPN connection between AWS Client VPN endpoints and your laptop.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpnlogin.jpg)

Back to **Client VPN Endpoints** console, click **Connections** to check the connection status. You can also check the status at your laptop by using command like **ifconfig**, **netstat -rn** for MacOS or **ipconfig** and **route print** for Windows.
 
![Deployment Diagram](images/vpncheck.jpg)

5) Test your VPN Connection

* Open you browser and link to <https://www.whatismyip.com/>
* Ping 168.95.1.1
* Ping www.amazon.com

Awesome!! Public IP is from Ashburn, VA US owned by Amazon. In term of ping result, we know the connectivity is available but the RTT is not good enough. The reason is that all traffic routing to the destination will be encapsulated and transmitted over OpenVPN tunnel. And the source IP address will be translated to EIP of Client VPN ENI hosted in subnet **VPC4VPN-SN1** or **VPC4VPN-SN2**. That's the reason why **"whatismyip"** shows your location in Virginia not your real location.

![Deployment Diagram](images/pingcheck.jpg)

**Noted**

If you try to ping the Windows instance in VPC4VPN, don't forget to turn off the Windows firewall, otherwise the icmp will be blocked by Windows host firewall. 

Turn Windows Defender Firewall Off - <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off>  

Ping the Linux instances located in VPC10 to verify whether the vpn connection can reach to other VPCs. The answer is no because there is no routing information between VPC4VPN and VPC10. 

![Deployment Diagram](images/pingvpc10.jpg)

**STEP 4 - Create AWS Transit Gateway**
----------------------------------------------
**What is AWS Transit Gateway?**

A transit gateway acts as a regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your virtual private clouds (VPC) and VPN connections. A transit gateway scales elastically based on the volume of network traffic. Routing through a transit gateway operates at layer 3, where the packets are sent to a specific next-hop attachment, based on their destination IP addresses.

![Deployment Diagram](images/step4.jpg)

1) Create the Transit Gateway

Open the Amazon VPC console, choose **Transit Gateways** and **Create Transit Gateway**. Type **Networking Workshop** for **Name tag** and leave others setting as default.

![Deployment Diagram](images/createtgw.jpg)

2) Attach Your VPCs to Your Transit Gateways

Choose **Transit Gateway Attachments** and **Create Transit Gateway Attachment**. Select **tgw-xxxxxx** and choose **VPC** for **Attachment type**. 

Type **VPC4VPN** for **Attachment name tag**, select **VPC4VPN** for **VPC ID**. Select **us-east-1a** and **us-east-1b** for **Subnet IDs**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/tgwattach.jpg)

Repeat the step above to create the attachments for VPC10 and VPC20. Verify the final state of each VPC is **available**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/tgwattach2.jpg)

3) Verify Transit Gateway Route Tables

Choose **Transit Gateway Route Tables** and go through each tab. Make sure the CIDR of each VPC is listed under the **Routes** tab.

![Deployment Diagram](images/tgwroute.jpg)

4) Add Routes between the Transit Gateway and your VPCs

Choose **Route Tables**, select **VPC4VPN-RT** and click **Edit routes** under **Routes** tab.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpcroute.jpg)

Click **Add route**, type **10.10.0.0/16**,**10.20.0.0/16** for **Destination** and select **tgw-xxxxxxx** for **Target**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpcroute2.jpg)

Repeat the step above to add the routes to **VPC10-RT** and **VPC20-RT**. Verify that the CIDR of each VPC is included in every route table. 

![Deployment Diagram](images/vpcroute3.jpg)

5) Test the Connectivity Between Client VPN and VPC10/VPC20

Find the private IP of instance located in VPC10/VPC20. Back to the EC2 console, select the instance with name of "ICMP Client in VPC10" and you will see **Private IPs** under **Description**. In my EC2 console, the private IPs are:

* ICMP Client in VPC10 - 10.10.1.162
* ICMP Client in VPC20 - 10.20.1.152  

![Deployment Diagram](images/instanceip.jpg)

Confirm the OpenVPN tunnel is still connected, open a terminal window and ping the two private IPs to see whether the Transit Gateway is working well.

![Deployment Diagram](images/tgwpingtest.jpg)

You can ssh into the Linux instance in VPC10 and ping the private IP of instance in VPC20. In the diagram below, in addition to IP, the internal domain name of instance can be used to test too. Do you know why?

![Deployment Diagram](images/instance1ping.jpg)

**STEP 5 - AWS Route 53 and DNS Resolver**
----------------------------------------------
![Deployment Diagram](images/step5.jpg)

1) Create a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone for VPCs

Open Route 53 console, choose **Hosted zones** and click **Create Hosted Zone**. Type your domain name (ex. workshop.aws.com) and select **Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC** for **Type**. Finally, select the VPC for this workshop under **N.Virginia** region and click **Create**. 

![Deployment Diagram](images/hostedzone.jpg)

After hosted zone successfully created, click **Back to Hosted Zones** and select your domain name. Associate the other two VPCs (VPC10 and VPC20) to the hosted zone.

![Deployment Diagram](images/hostedzone1.jpg)

2) Create Domain Name for Instances

Choose **Create Record Set** and do the following:

**Instance in VPC4VPN**
	
	Name: ec2-vpc4vpn
	Type: A-IPv4 address
	Alias: No
	TTL: 0
	Value: your instance private ip in VPC4VPN (ex. 10.1.1.25)
	Routing Policy: Simple  
	
![Deployment Diagram](images/dn.jpg)

Repeat the step above to create A record for instances in VPC10 and VPC20
	
**Instance in VPC10**
	
	Name: ec2-vpc10
	Type: A-IPv4 address
	Alias: No
	TTL: 0
	Value: your instance private ip in VPC10 (ex. 10.10.1.162)
	Routing Policy: Simple 
	
**Instance in VPC20**
	
	Name: ec2-vpc20
	Type: A-IPv4 address
	Alias: No
	TTL: 0
	Value: your instance private ip in VPC20 (ex. 10.20.1.152)
	Routing Policy: Simple 

Confirm the DNS records are created successfully. 

![Deployment Diagram](images/arecord.jpg)

3) Create Route 53 Resolver

Back to EC2 console, create a Security Group with inbound rule of allowing TCP/UDP port 53 from anywhere. The Security Group will be applied to the Route 53 Inbound Resolver.

![Deployment Diagram](images/sgforinbound.jpg)

Choose **Inbound endpoints** in the navigation pane, click **Create inbound endpoint** and do the following:

* Endpoint name: EndpointForVPN
* VPC in the Region: VPC4VPN
* Security group for this endpoint: R53 Inbound Resolver

![Deployment Diagram](images/inendpoint1.jpg)

* IP address #1

		Availability Zone: us-east-1a
		Subnet: VPC4VPN-SN1
		IP address: Select "Use an IP address that you specify" and type 10.1.1.250 
		
* IP address #2

		Availability Zone: us-east-1b
		Subnet: VPC4VPN-SN2
		IP address: Select "Use an IP address that you specify" and type 10.1.2.250 
	
![Deployment Diagram](images/inendpoint2.jpg)

Select the inbound endpoint you created, click **View details**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/viewdetail.jpg)

4) Add Inbound Resolver IP to AWS Client VPN Endpoints

Back to **Client VPN Endpoints** console, select your endpoint, click **Action** and choose **Modify Client VPN Endpoint**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/modifyvpn.jpg)

Select **Yes** for **DNS Servers enabled** and type **10.1.1.250** and **10.1.2.250** for DNS Server IP. Leave others setting as blank and click **Modify Client VPN Endpoint**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/modifyvpndns.jpg)

5) Test Connectivity With Domain Name

Reconnect your OpenVPN and verify that the DNS server IPs of your laptop are **10.1.1.250** and **10.1.2.250**. Use command like **nslookup** or **dig** to query the domain name of instance in VPC10/VPC/20.  

	$ nslookup
	> server
	> ec2-vpc4vpn.workshop.aws.com
	> ec2-vpc10.workshop.aws.com
	> ec2-vpc20.workshop.aws.com

![Deployment Diagram](images/nslookup.jpg)

Ping the domain name of instances and browse **www.amazon.com**.

![Deployment Diagram](images/final.jpg)
